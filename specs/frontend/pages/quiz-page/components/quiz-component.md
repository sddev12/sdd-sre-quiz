# Quiz Component

This is the main component of the quiz page. It matches the style of the homepageâ€™s main panel and is responsible for the entire quiz-taking experience.

## Responsibilities

- Display the users name.
- Show quiz progress: current question number (e.g., 1/20).
- Show elapsed time since quiz start.
- Display the current question and answer options.
- Allow answer selection (only one at a time).
- Enable the submit button only after an answer is selected.
- On submit, call the `/submit-answer` API endpoint to record the answer for the user and question.
- If the API returns an error, display the error and allow the user to retry.
- On success, fetch the next question from the backend and display it.
- Repeat until all 20 questions are answered.
- After the last question, display a completion message, the users score, total time, and a button to view the leaderboard.

## State

- currentQuestionIndex: number
- currentQuestion: { id, text, answers: [{id, text}] }
- selectedAnswerId: string | null
- elapsedTime: number (seconds)
- score: number
- isComplete: boolean
- isLoading: boolean

## Behavior & Logic

- On mount, fetch the first question and start the timer.
- When an answer is selected, enable the submit button.
- On submit:
  - Call `submitAnswer` (which POSTs to `/submit-answer`) with the selected answer, username, and questionId.
  - If the API returns an error, display the error and allow the user to retry.
  - If not last question, fetch the next question from the backend and reset selection.
  - If last question, stop timer, calculate score, set `isComplete`.
- On completion, show score, time, and leaderboard button.

## Accessibility

- All buttons and options are keyboard accessible.
- High-contrast, large clickable areas.
- No color-only indicators for selection.

## Example Usage

```jsx
<QuizComponent
  userName="Alice"
  totalQuestions={20}
  fetchQuestion={fetchQuestion}
  submitAnswer={submitAnswer}
  onQuizComplete={handleQuizComplete}
/>
```
