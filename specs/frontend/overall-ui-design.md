# Project Specification: "WHITE INTERFACE" — SRE Quiz Application

## Overview

**Project Name:** WHITE INTERFACE  
**Purpose:** Build a web application that delivers interactive SRE quizzes through a futuristic, minimal, and high-contrast interface inspired by the control-panel aesthetic of _Black Mirror: "White Christmas"_.  
**Objective:** Achieve a sense of precision, calm, and intelligence — as if the user is operating a sophisticated yet sterile machine.

## Design Language & Aesthetic

### Core Principles

- **Monochrome Minimalism:** The interface relies almost entirely on black, white, and subtle grayscale.
- **Precision and Order:** Every visual element aligns to a clean geometric grid.
- **Sterile Futurism:** The UI should feel like a control room or laboratory instrument rather than a website.
- **Function Over Ornament:** No decoration, gradients, or embellishments — only necessary shapes, lines, and text.
- **Calm Interactivity:** Feedback is quiet and deliberate; nothing flashes, bounces, or slides dramatically.

## Color Palette

| Element                             | Color      | Hex       |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Background                          | White      | `#FFFFFF` |
| Foreground (Text / Lines / Borders) | Black      | `#000000` |
| Accent / Hover / Divider            | Light Gray | `#EAEAEA` |
| Error / Warning (Optional)          | Red        | `#FF0000` |

Optional: provide a **dark inversion mode** using the same principles (black background, white outlines).

---

## Typography

- **Primary Font:** A technical or monospaced typeface such as `IBM Plex Mono`, `Roboto Mono`, or `Space Grotesk`.
- **All Caps:** Interface text should use uppercase for clarity and uniformity.
- **Font Size Hierarchy:**
  - Headings: 24px–28px
  - Subheadings: 16px–18px
  - Labels / Body Text: 12px–14px
- **Alignment:** Centered or left-aligned within panels; no justified text.

---

## Layout & Structure

### General Layout

- The interface is built on a **rectangular grid** system.
- Each section appears as an **outlined panel** or **box**, separated by fine black lines.
- Panels have **uniform padding and spacing**, never overlapping or using drop shadows.
- The layout should evoke a sense of **modular hardware panels**.

### Recommended Zones

1. **Header Area**

   - Static title bar with application or context label (e.g., “CONTROL PANEL” or “QUIZ TERMINAL”).
   - Uses inverted contrast (black background, white text).

2. **Main Interaction Area**

   - The central focus for user interaction.
   - Contains controls, questions, or status panels (but content details are abstracted at this stage).

3. **Sidebar / Status Panel (Optional)**

   - Displays system-like information (progress, state indicators, or navigation zones).
   - Should remain consistent in layout across screens.

4. **Footer / Meta Information (Optional)**
   - Minimal text only (e.g., version number or subtle label).

## Interaction & Behavior

- **Hover / Active Feedback:**
  - Change border thickness or invert color when selected.
  - Avoid animations longer than 150ms.
- **Transitions:**
  - Subtle fades or instant state changes — no slide transitions.
- **Sound Feedback (Optional):**
  - Minimal, soft click or tone to simulate interaction realism.
- **Responsiveness:**
  - Scales proportionally; maintain grid ratios and panel balance on any device.
- **Input Consistency:**
  - Identical experience for mouse, touch, and keyboard input.

## Visual Components

| Component Type                 | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Panel**                      | Outlined container representing a functional module or zone.                               |
| **Button / Control**           | Rectangular or circular outline with clear label text; no fills or icons unless essential. |
| **Indicator / Status Element** | Small, outlined shapes (circles or bars) to show binary states.                            |
| **Typography Label**           | Uppercase text for clear readability and consistency.                                      |

All components must look **functional** rather than decorative.

## Accessibility & Usability

- Maintain **high contrast** for all text and interactive elements.
- Ensure **keyboard accessibility** (tab focus and key activation).
- Do not rely solely on color to convey meaning — use text and shape.
- Use **simple, consistent motion** for all UI feedback.

---

## Future Extensions

- Introduce **inverted dark mode** toggle.
- Add subtle **grid overlay** for depth and structure.
- Create a **dynamic environment** mode (e.g., simulated “system startup” animation).
